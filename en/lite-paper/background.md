## Insufficient liquidity of NFTs

The current NFT market is in a dilemma. On the one hand, new NFT projects continue to emerge, for example, celebrities and big brands launch NFTs; on the other hand, each NFT project would have tens of thousands of NFT works, and every NFT transaction depends on matching a single buyer to a single seller, which causes the extremely low liquidity of NFTs.
 
At the same time, due to the uniqueness of NFT assets, there are also great differences between the same series of NFTs, and transaction decisions are subjectively affected. Popular NFT models are widely sought after, while ordinary models are unpopular, further resulting in poor liquidity of most NFTs.

 
## NFT overtop initial price

In the NFT space, the speculation-based pricing is undoubtedly a real issue. Many projects don't have enough value to justify high prices. Instead they rely solely on "influencers" to drive prices up. This leads people to invest in such projects due to the fear of missing out caused by the FOMO mentality. When the boom fades, they will only lose everything.
 
For users who have not yet entered the market, the threshold for purchasing an NFT with a few or dozens of ETHs is too high. Most people cannot afford to buy high-priced NFTs, let alone build NFT investment portfolios. This makes NFTs exclusive for the whale.
 
A real community creator will do initial pricing at a reasonable level.
