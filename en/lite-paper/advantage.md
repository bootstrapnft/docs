# Advantage
BootstrapNFT improves the liquidity of NFT projects by fragmenting NFTs. It allows more people to trade NFTs at lower prices, enabling more investors to own coveted early-stage blue-chip NFTs. Meanwhile, it creates a price floor by creating vTokens with similar prices, making it easier for investors to redeem the original NFT assets.
 
BootstrapNFT sets the initial price of NFT through a "Dutch auction", or "drop auction". Its auction price will decrease sequentially from high to low, preventing the price of new NFTs from soaring due to early speculation and hype. It helps reduce the FOMO sentiment to a certain extent, and make the initial pricing of NFT projects at a reasonable level.
 
Thus, it provides the NFT founding team and the wider community with the advantages of:
* high liquidity

Fragmentation increases the liquidity of NFTs by allowing more people to trade NFTs at lower prices. At the same time, users do not need to match a single buyer to a seller following traditional NFT transactions. Smart order routing means that users can obtain vTokens at lower slippage prices and redeem NFTs at any time, thereby improving the liquidity of NFTs.
 
* high fairness

Continued downward pressure on prices discourages users/bots from front-running and bulk-buying, giving people ample opportunity to participate in the trade at fair prices, which naturally leads to the fair and equitable distribution.
 
* Stable price discovery

It is optimized for small orders so that large quantities bought by whales cannot affect the price. A well-liquid startup pool is able to accommodate a lot of buying and pull back before other potential buyers join. The price volatility is minimized for a healthy and stable price discovery process.
