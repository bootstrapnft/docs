# Use Cases
In this section, we would describe how BootstrapNFTs are used by various players in the NFT ecosystem:

**NFT Trader** - Allows you to instantly buy, sell and exchange series of NFTs. Sellers don’t need to look for buyers, and buyers don’t need to look for sellers. And the price of each NFT in the collection is the same.

**NFT project/community** - Allows projects to create a liquidity startup pool to help find a solid floor price for your NFT and solve the problem of opaque pricing in the NFT market.

**NFT bidders** - BootstrapNFT is designed for NFT initial issuance price discovery, allowing users to participate in the auction of early NFT projects, and ordinary community members can participate at a fairer price.
