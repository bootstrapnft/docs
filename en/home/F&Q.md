## F&Q

### What is NFT Fragmentation?

Fragmented NFTs are NFTs that are broken down into fragments, which is allowed to be sold individually. Every buyer of these shards will own a fraction of the overall value of the NFT. This enables long-tail users to partially buy unaffordable NFTs and allows NFT holders to immediately cash out part of the NFT’s value without necessarily having to sell them outright.
 
### How does NFT fragmentation work?

ERC-721 and ERC-1155 are the two most commonly used token standards when creating NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, both of which can generate unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The opposite ERC-20 standard is used to create fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are interchangeable with each other, and each unit has the same utility and intrinsic value. Thus, smart contracts are deployed and multiple ERC-20 tokens linked to an indivisible ERC-721 NFT are generated to ensure that anyone holding these ERC-20 tokens can have fractional ownership of the associated NFT.
 
### Why does it need to be fragmented before its auction?
 
Improve the liquidity of NFT transactions and exert the value of asset liquidity;
Allow more users to trade NFTs at lower prices so that ordinary users can easily participate in blue-chip projects;
Reduce the risk of NFT investments;
NFTs fragmentation can provide a price discovery mechanism to determine the value of a particular NFT. (As fragmented ERC-20 tokens are sold on the open market, their prices help provide a reasonable valuation for the price of tokenized assets.)
 
###Can NFT be redeemed after the split?

NFT fragmentation is a reversible process that can be reassembled into a complete NFT after splitting.
 
### What are the main application markets of BootstrapNFT?

Buy, sell and exchange series NFTs instantly. Sellers don’t need to look for buyers, and buyers don’t need to look for sellers. And the price of each NFT in the collection is the same.
Allow projects to create a liquidity startup pool. It helps find a solid floor price for your NFT and solve the problem of opaque pricing in the NFT market.
BootstrapNFT is designed for NFT ICO price discovery. Users are allowed to participate in the auction of early NFT projects, and ordinary community members can participate at a fairer price.
 
### Is BootstrapNFT completely permissionless?

Yes, BootstrapNFT contracts are completely permissionless on-chain smart contracts.
 
### How to redeem NFT in the vault for participants without entering NFTmint?

Please obtain vTokens in SWAP and redeem them in the vault.
 
### Does BootstrapNFT have tokens? What is its function?

$BSN is BootstrapNFT’s governance token, providing liquidity and governance to different BootstrapNFT token pairs.
