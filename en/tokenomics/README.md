# Tokenomics
## Governance rights

$BSN is BootstrapNFT’s governance token and can provide liquidity to different BootstrapNFT token pairs. Also, it has voting power that drives decentralized governance for governance token holders and protocol stakeholders (80% of voting tokens are required to support proposals to pass, and the voting period lasts 24 hours).

Here's what eligible $BSN holders can decide during the development phase:

* Reward distribution for liquidity programs.

* Review ecosystem partners.

* The DAO's team structure and marketing spend.

* There is more to be decided.



## Supply and distribution

The total supply of $BSN is 100M, distributed as follows:

* Liquidity Provider 40%

* Ecosystem Fund & Partners 20%

* Founding team, consultants, technical development 20%

* Dao treasury 15%

* Private investment 5%




### Community (liquidity provider)

Distribute approximately 4 million of $BSN annually to liquidity providers through the Liquidity Enhancement Program. $BSN governance has the power to mine liquidity and can choose to keep or change the system.



### Founder, consultant, technology development

20 million tokens are allocated to founders, advisors and technical developers with a vesting period of 24 months.



### Ecosystem fund

Allocate 20 million to the Ecosystem Fund. The fund will be used to attract and incentivize strategic partners who will help the balancer ecosystem grow and prosper. $BSN holders will ultimately decide which partners to work with and how to use the fund for years to come.



### DAO treasury

Allocate 15 million to the DAO Governance Fund with a vesting period of 24 months. $BSN holders can dictate the DAO’s team structure and marketing spend.



### Private investment

It is estimated that 5 million will be reserved for the seed round and private equity round, and the specific details have not been disclosed.
