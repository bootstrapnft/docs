# Minting

Select a vault, choose the same series of NFTs in the wallet (single or multiple NFTs together) to mint to the vault and convert them into vTokens.

 

Tips: Vaults are usually floor vaults, which means that minting higher-value NFTs will provide the same results as lower-value NFTs in the collection.

Click the "mint" button to generate a vToken. Each NFT will return a vToken, minus the minting fee (5%).
